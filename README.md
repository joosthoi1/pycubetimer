# Cube Timer
A Rubik's Cube timer built in Python. The timer starts upon clicking the Start button and can be stopped either by pressing space-bar or by clicking the Stop button. The timer automatically saves all the times in a text file. 

Future plans include:
1. ~~Display of old times inside the Timer Window~~ Done!
2. ~~Display of Averages~~ Done for AO5 as of now!
3. ~~Display of Scrambles for the Rubik's Cube~~ Done for 3x3 as of now!
